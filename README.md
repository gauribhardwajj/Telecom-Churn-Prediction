## What is Churn Rate?

Customer churn is the percentage of customers that stopped using your companyâ€™s product or service during a certain time frame.

Churn rate is a key indicator of customer satisfaction:
- A low churn rate signifies satisfied customers.
- A high churn rate indicates that customers are leaving.

Churn serves as a valuable measure of growth potential. It tracks the customers you lose, while growth rates track the new customers you gain. Analyzing these metrics together reveals your business's overall growth:
- If your growth rate exceeds your churn rate, your business is expanding.
- Conversely, if churn surpasses growth, your business is contracting.
